# Synthetic data studies for hERG model

All results are cached, so all figures can be re-generated by simply running the figure plots.
Synthetic data study for the full voltage-clamp experiment model can be reproduced by running: `fit-full2vclinleak-full2vclinleak.py` for syntheitic experiment `0`, `1`, ...; or simply `fit-full2vclinleak-full2vclinleak.sh` to run all.

[Figure S6](figs/parameters-error-full2vclinleak-full2vclinleak.pdf): Run `plot-parameter-error.py`.

A similar synthetic data study was performed for the simplified voltage-clamp experiment model: `fit-simvclinleak-simvclinleak.py` for syntheitic experiment `0`, `1`, ...; or simply `fit-simvclinleak-simvclinleak.sh` to run all. The results are [here](out/syn-simvclinleak-simvclinleak).
